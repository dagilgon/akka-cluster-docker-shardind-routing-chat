    <h2>Akka Cluster with Docker</h2>

    <p>
        This is a small akka cluster application that demonstrates how to run akka nodes
        inside docker containers. For a detailed description read <a href="http://mukis.de/pages/akka-cluster-with-docker-containers/">
        this blog</a> entry.

    <h2>Running</h2>
    
    <p>
        First thing to do is creating the docker image. Easy:
        <pre><code>sbt docker:publishLocal</code></pre>
    </p>
    
    <p>And then we start our containers. You have to pickup the ip adresses of your seed containers.
    This can be done either by reading the stdout of the running docker container or you <em>docker inspect seed-1</em>.
            <pre><code>
docker run --name seed-1 akka-docker:2.3.4 --seed
docker run --name seed-2 akka-docker:2.3.4 --seed <ip-of-your-seed-1>:2551
docker run --name node-1 akka-docker:2.3.4 <ip-of-your-seed-1>:2551 <ip-of-your-seed-2>:2551
docker run --name node-2 akka-docker:2.3.4 <ip-of-your-seed-1>:2551 <ip-of-your-seed-2>:2551
        </code></pre>
    <p>
       You have now a akka cluster running in separated docker containers.
    </p>

    <h2>Seed IPs - Where from?</h2>
    <p>
       For this activator you have to set the ip adresses manually. However you can use provision
       tools/frameworks like zookeeper, chef or puppet (or simple dns hosts) to fire up your cluster
       automatically. This is another problem not solved/described by this activator.
